### Test Positivity Classification: 
Counties with test percent positivity <5.0% or with <20 tests in past 14 days: Green; test percent positivity 5.0%-10.0% or with <500 tests and <2000 tests/100k and >10% positivity over 14 days: Yellow; >10.0% and not meeting the criteria for “Green” or “Yellow”: Red. Test positivity is rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent before classifying.

### Data Sources:
Testing data: HHS Unified Testing Dataset; Population data: 2019 Census

### Documentation:
The data presented represent viral COVID-19 laboratory diagnostic and screening test (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR) results and exclude antibody and antigen tests. COVID-19 Electronic Lab Reporting (CELR) state health department-reported data are used to describe county-level viral COVID-19 laboratory test (RT-PCR) result totals when information is available on patients’ county of residence or healthcare providers’ practice location. HHS Protect laboratory data (provided directly to Federal Government from public health labs, hospital labs, and commercial labs) are used otherwise. Some states did not report on certain days, which may affect the total number of tests resulted and positivity rate values. Total viral (RT-PCR) laboratory tests are the number of tests performed, not the number of individuals tested. Viral (RT-PCR) laboratory test positivity rate is the number of positive tests divided by the total number of tests performed and resulted. Resulted tests are assigned to a timeframe based on this hierarchy of test-related dates: 1. test date; 2. result date; 3. specimen received date; 4. specimen collection date. Resulted tests are assigned to a county based on a hierarchy of test-related locations: 1. patient residency; 2. provider facility location; 3. ordering facility location; 4. performing organization location.

### Additional Notes:
During the week of Sept 14, 2020, the following updates were made to the county percent test positivity characterization methodology. In order to use a greater amount of data to calculate percent test positivity and improve the stability of values, the indicator was expanded to include 14 days of data instead of 7 days. Further, because there are instances where counties with high test positivity rates may reflect low testing levels rather than high levels of viral transmission, additional criteria were added to re-assign counties with low testing volume to lower nursing home staff testing tiers (i.e., communities with low levels of testing and high test positivity (>10%) are reassigned to either yellow or green testing tiers). Nursing homes may set their testing frequency based on the color-coded reassigned positivity classification.
